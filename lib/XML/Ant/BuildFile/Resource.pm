=head1 NAME

XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource - Role for Ant build file resources

=head1 VERSION

version 0.216

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource::Foo;
    use Moose;
    with 'XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource';

    after BUILD => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        print "I'm a ", $self->resource_name, "\n";
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role shared by resources in an
L<XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project|XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 resource_name

Name of the task's XML node.

=head2 id

C<id> attribute of this resource.

=head2 as_string

Every role consumer must implement the C<as_string> method.

=head2 content

L<XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource|XML::Ant::BuildFile::Resource> provides a
default C<content> attribute, but it only returns C<undef>.  Consumers should
use the C<around> method modifier to return something else in order to
support resources with C<refid> attributes

=head1 METHODS

=head2 BUILD

After a resource is constructed, it adds its L<id|/id> and
L<string representation|/as_string> to the
L<XML::Ant::Properties|XML::Ant::Properties> singleton with C<toString:>
prepended to the C<id>.

=head1 SUPPORT

=head2 Perldoc

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
