=head1 NAME

XML::Ant::BuildFile::Role::HasProjects - Compose a collection of Ant build file projects

=head1 VERSION

version 0.216

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Package;
    use Moose;
    with 'XML::Ant::BuildFile::Role::HasProjects';

    sub frobnicate_projects {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->working_copy('/dir/to/search');
        print "Found these projects:\n";
        print "$_\n" for @{$self->project_files};
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Moose::Role|Moose::Role> helps you compose a collection of Ant
project files found in a directory of source code.  The directory is searched
recursively for files ending in F<.xml>, skipping any symbolic links as well
as F<CVS> and Subversion F<.svn> directories.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 working_copy

A L<Path::Class::Dir|Path::Class::Dir> to search for L</projects>.

=head2 projects

Reference to an array of
L<XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project|XML::Ant::BuildFile::Project>s in the
current C<working_copy> directory.

=head1 SUPPORT

=head2 Perldoc

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
